## Project Description:
This assignment serves as an introduction to version control systems. It allowed us to gain hands on practice with VCSes by utilizng Cloud9 and Github to create repositories. In this assignment we first created a new workspace in Cloud9 and created a GitHub account. We then linked the accounts and configured Git in Cloud 9. Files were moved to the local repositorty in Cloud9. Then a remote repository was created and files were pushed to GitHub. We then edited the HTML document with the five topics we learned in this lesson. Final files were then moved to the local repository and pushed to the remote repository to create a new commit. We then completed the assignment by publishing it.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that version control systems allow for easy file sharing, automatically notes changes, provides automatic backups, doesn't allow files to be overwritted, and allows files or the entire project to be reverted to its previous state.
2. I learned that there are local and remote repositories. A remote repository resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members, while a local repository resides on a local machine of an individual user.
3. I learned that Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that was created to handle all-sized projects with speed and efficiency. Git is different from other VCSes because it doesnâ€™t store data as a list of file-based changes, but stores it like a stream of snapshots.
